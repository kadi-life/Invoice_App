# Invoice App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Registration in Production

The user registration was failing in the production environment but working locally. The following changes were made to fix this issue:

- Added enhanced CSRF middleware (`users/csrf_middleware.py`) to provide better error logging for CSRF token issues
- Updated `settings.py` to use the enhanced CSRF middleware
- Added explicit CSRF token to the registration form template
- Added form error logging in the `RegisterView` class to help diagnose issues

### 2. Invoice Status Updates

The system was preventing any edits to invoices after creation (for data integrity), but users needed to update the status without creating new invoices. The following changes were made to fix this issue:

- Created a new view `update_invoice_status` in `invoices/views.py` that allows updating only the status field
- Created a new template `templates/invoices/update_status.html` for the status update form
- Updated URL routing in `invoices/urls.py` to include the new status update view
- Updated invoice list and view templates to link to the status update page instead of the edit page

## How to Use

### Updating Invoice Status

1. Navigate to the invoice list or view an individual invoice
2. Click the "Update Status" button (previously labeled "Edit Invoice")
3. Select the new status from the dropdown menu
4. Click "Update Status" to save the changes

This allows changing the invoice status (Pending, Paid, Overdue) without modifying other invoice details, maintaining data integrity while providing the needed functionality.
